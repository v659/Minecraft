## Overview

This project is a voxel-based procedural terrain engine built with the Ursina Engine, featuring biome-blended terrains and detailed mountain generation. It includes tools for resizing PNG images to 64x64 pixels and customizable shading with a Phong shader.

The engine supports:

- Procedural generation of varied terrain biomes such as mountains, hills, deserts, and more.
- Minecraft like blocks creating terrains of different biomes using perlin noise
- Efficient voxel rendering with interactive blocks.
- Image preprocessing utility to resize textures for voxel blocks.
- Optional Phong shading for enhanced visual effects.

## Features

- Procedural terrain generation with multiple biome types.
- Custom mountain model generation with secondary peaks and cliffs.
- Easy integration with Ursina's voxel system.
- Texture resizing script to standardize assets.
- Custom GLSL shader to add realistic lighting to the terrain.(Optional to add in code)
